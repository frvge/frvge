- 👋 Hi, I’m @frvge
- 👀 I’m interested in improving end-user experience (web performance and other non-functional areas) or developer experience (devops)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the details of Postgres, basic Unreal Engine 5, networking and maybe robot tests or Puppet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool side-projects that have a chance of turning into a revenue stream
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me on twitter via the same handle.
